            <p>Project Description: This is PHP! This second project converted the first simple webpage into an PHP MVC
            stucture that sends variables and data back and forth.  It is now becoming more 
            interactive.  The data values are hardcoded and will be accessing a database in the 
            next assignment. </p> 
            <p>Design Decisions: I didn't make many decisions with this project because the directory was chosen for me. 
            You'll probably notice that it is structured so that Advisors link to Students who link to forms. </p> 
            <p>Note to TA's: When clicking through my program you may notice that hitting the top back tabs will result 
            in 'undefined' variable headings.  This is because I knew in the next assignment it would be much 
            easier to update those using the database and not worry about them now. </p> 
            <p>Testing: Testing is simple in this assignment.  Every link can be accessed in 5 minutes to make sure they all work. </p> 
            <p>References: My inspiration came directly from Jim's example code and no other sources.</p>
