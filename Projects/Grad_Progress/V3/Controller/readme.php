            <p>Note to TA's:</p> 
            <p>Testing: Testing is simple in this assignment.  Every link can be accessed in 5 minutes to make sure they all work. </p> 
            <p>References: My inspiration came directly from Jim's example code and no other sources.</p>
            <p>Peer Review:  I looked at Chris Weeter's webpages. I liked his Utes logo and top menu. The red is a good color scheme
                for the U. His tables are straightforward and simple which is great. I like how he uses checkmarkers and red X's to 
                show student compliance. I suggested that he add side margins to his pages, change a signature line into a checkbox, 
                and title his tables as "Students" instead of "List of Students".
