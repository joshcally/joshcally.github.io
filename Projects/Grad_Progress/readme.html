            <h3>Island Cars</h3>
            <p>During a particularly work-heavy week of the busy CS-filled semester, I impulsively bought flights to Kauai for the moment finals ended.  While searching for a good car rental agency on this tropical paradise of an island, I came across this site: http://www.islandcars.net.  The colors are bland, the font is outdated, and the links have been promising improvements for the last 13 years.  If I had stumbled upon that page unknowingly I would have assumed the Island Cars business had bit the dust decades ago.  Upon inspection the header tag revealed that the last update to this site was performed on May 20, 2003.  It is about time for an update.  Chris and I decided to redesign the entire site as a challenge for our final project.  We created the main page with Bootstrap to give it a professional feel.  Users can check certain dates for vehicle availability.  We allowed reservations to be made on the site that automatically store information in a database.  An administrator may securely log in to manage the vehicle fleet and process reservations.  These improvements provide much of the functionality that we would expect to see from a rental agency website.  It is possible that the information we display on the website and the ability to make reservations could save the agency from hiring too many people to perform those simple tasks.  With a professional and useful website completed, Chris and I are proud to display our work for future employers.  This site has the potential to become the live website for Island Cars of Kauai if they wanted to tweak it to make it their own.

             <h3>TETRIS</h3>
             <p>Team: Josh Callahan & Chris Weeter
            </p>
             <p>Product Description: We built TETRIS on an HTML5 Canvas using PIXI
            </p>
             <p>Software Engineering Techniques: Our Tetris game is a class object. It uses a matrix board that contains
                 Cell objects. This makes the methods easy to understand.
            </p>
            <p>Additional Features: This game features the original Tetris soundtrack! There are other sounds
                as well. There is chain scoring with multiple lines providing more points.  The levels increment
                over time.  The game allows for a restart when finished.  High scores are displayed.
            </p>
             <p>Note to TA: Use Chrome! <br>
             The unobfuscated version can be found on either of our github repos.
            <h3>V7</h3>
             <p>Testing: Sign in as User: dgs, Password: graduation
            <p>Product Description: The DGS now has access to Student Performance Metrics pulled from the database.
            </p>
            <p>Graph Design Decisions: The idea behind my 3 graphs was to allow the DGS to keep track of how the advisors
                are helping students progress through the program.
                The first bar graph is useful because it allows the DGS to see how each advisor is
                handling their students.  An advisor with many students behind schedule will easily stick out in the graph.
                The second pie chart allows the advisor to see how the students are distributed among advisors.  This would
                allow the DGS to maintain an even workload for all the advisors.
                The third scatter plot is useful because it allows the DGS to see trends in the amount of credit hours a student
                has completed compared with his/her overall GPA.  
            <h3>V6</h3>
            <p>Product Description: My entire CSS design has been replaced by Bootstrap components.  It now looks professional.
            </p>
            <p>Bootstrap Additions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cover Page</li>
                    <li>Login</li>
                    <li>Navbar</li>
                    <li>Buttons</li>
                    <li>New User Form</li>
                    <li>Carousel</li>
                    <li>Sticky footers</li>
                    <li>Glyphicons</li>
                    <li>Labels</li>
                    <li>Table</li>
                </ul>
            </p>        
            <p>Screen Size Scalability:  The pages are built to fit on all devices. The navbar at the top becomes a dropdown menu
                for mobile devices.  The form labels are to the left of the input boxes on bigger screens, but are placed above them
                on a mobile screen.  A mobile user would have no problems creating an account and viewing information.  Large buttons
                are used in the place of small hyperlinks in most cases, allowing mobile users to have an easier time.  The cover page
                image fills any size of screen.
            </p>
            <p>Comparison: My previous design was custom built to simply fulfill most of the functionality it needed. The color scheme
                looked good but the fonts and block containers looked like they were designed a decade ago.  The current Bootstrap
                site is more modern and professional. It is built to be used on screens of all sizes unlike the previous custom version.
                It looks more generic, but my opinion is that people are comfortable with sites that all look the same.
            </p>
            <p>Testing: Sign in as User: jonny, Password: password
            <h3>V5</h3>
            <p>Product Description: Users can create accounts and log in with those accounts.  Certain webpages can only be viewed
                by those who are logged in as a certain role.
            </p>
            <p>Design Decisions: The login and password inputs are shown on the main page.  When a user attempts to view a 
                webpage containing user information without logging in, they are redirected to the main page.  Passwords are hashed
                using bcrypt before being entered into the server database.</p>
             <p>Notes to TA's: Use Chrome. Safari does not support HTML5 Validation.  Create an account and log in as that
                 user or use the provided example on the main page.
             <p>Testing: I used Chrome to log in and out of different accounts.  An example account is shown in the main page.</p>
             <p>References: The verifyLogin portion of my assignment relied upon Jim's Girl Scout Cookie website.  The rest was my own
                 decision, adding pieces of information to all pages in my existing assignment.
             </p>
            <h3>V4</h3>
            <p>Product Description: My Progress Tracker now lets a user view a homepage with forms that are held in a database.
                New users and progress forms can be created and added to the database.</p>
            <p>Form Validation: To create a new user requires a few textboxes that need form validation. I relied upon
                Chrome's "required" keyword in html that will pull up warning box if a text entry is not in the right format.
                This feature would not work for Safari. I used the built-in HTML5 validations that are quite useful.
                Creating a new progress form was a different matter. I decided to only use selection boxes and checkboxes
                to make it impossible for the user to submit erroneous data.</p>
             <p>Design Decisions: The majority of my time was spent fixing the database so that user and form data stayed consistent
                across all tables.  I did not find it necessary to update the new forms or edit old forms. This task seemed unnecessary
                when compared with the core functionality of the progress tracker.
             <p>Testing: I started my design using a hard coded student profile.  Eventually I slowly worked my way into having
                 each page custom built to fit whichever student was logged in.  There are more than enough test data in my database.</p>
             <p>References: This assignment was accomplished with inspiration from Jim's code.  There are tiny snippets of html
                 validation that are pulled from W3 Schools.   
            <h3>V3</h3>
            <p>Testing: Testing is simple in this assignment.  Every link can be accessed in 5 minutes to make sure they all work. </p> 
            <p>References: My inspiration came directly from Jim's example code and no other sources.</p>
            <p>Peer Review:  I looked at Chris Weeter's webpages. I liked his Utes logo and top menu. The red is a good color scheme
                for the U. His tables are straightforward and simple which is great. I like how he uses checkmarkers and red X's to 
                show student compliance. I suggested that he add side margins to his pages, change a signature line into a checkbox, 
                and title his tables as "Students" instead of "List of Students".
            </p>
            <h3>V2</h3>
            <p>Project Description: This is PHP! This second project converted the first simple webpage into an PHP MVC
            stucture that sends variables and data back and forth.  It is now becoming more 
            interactive.  The data values are hardcoded and will be accessing a database in the 
            next assignment. </p> 
            <p>Design Decisions: I didn't make many decisions with this project because the directory was chosen for me. 
            You'll probably notice that it is structured so that Advisors link to Students who link to forms. </p> 
            <p>Note to TA's: When clicking through my program you may notice that hitting the top back tabs will result 
            in 'undefined' variable headings.  This is because I knew in the next assignment it would be much 
            easier to update those using the database and not worry about them now. </p> 
            <p>Testing: Testing is simple in this assignment.  Every link can be accessed in 5 minutes to make sure they all work. </p> 
            <p>References: My inspiration came directly from Jim's example code and no other sources.</p>
            <h3>V1</h3>
            <p>Project Description: This was my very first experience with webpage design.  I found this project to be both time-consuming
            and satisfying.  A few hours were spent learning the capabilities of HTML and CSS before starting.  W3
            was by far the best tutorial that I found.  Many snippets of my code were used from the tutorials of
            that website.</p>
            <p>References: The HTML was completely hand typed from me.  I viewed the templates of other websites to get a feel
                for how the divisions should be set up.  Most of my snippets of CSS were taken from the various
                tutorials found on W3.  My background landscape image was taken from photographyzoomin.blogspot.com.  
                The white shadow CSS behind the titles of my landing pages were taken from W3.  The top menu found
                on every page was a variation found from the CSS lists page.  For each of these components I
                customized them and made them my own.</p>
            <p>Design Decisions: My Ph.D. progress form looks very different from the print copy.  I tried to design it in such a way
                that it would be easier to get the right information when it was submitted.  This might help reduce
                the amount of difficult parsing that would need to be done. A signature was replaced
                by a checkbox because that is sufficient for most web forms.  
                </p>  
            <p>Testing: Testing was easy because I could click through every link to make sure they all worked.  I had to correct
                several reference issues that I found through this method. </p>
