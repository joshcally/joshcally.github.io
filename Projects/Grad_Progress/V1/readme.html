            <p>Name: Joshua Callahan </p>Testing:
            <p>Project Description: This was my very first experience with webpage design.  I found this project to be both time-consuming
            and satisfying.  A few hours were spent learning the capabilities of HTML and CSS before starting.  W3
            was by far the best tutorial that I found.  Many snippets of my code were used from the tutorials of
            that website.</p>
            <p>References: The HTML was completely hand typed from me.  I viewed the templates of other websites to get a feel
                for how the divisions should be set up.  Most of my snippets of CSS were taken from the various
                tutorials found on W3.  My background landscape image was taken from photographyzoomin.blogspot.com.  
                The white shadow CSS behind the titles of my landing pages were taken from W3.  The top menu found
                on every page was a variation found from the CSS lists page.  For each of these components I
                customized them and made them my own.</p>
            <p>Design Decisions: My Ph.D. progress form looks very different from the print copy.  I tried to design it in such a way
                that it would be easier to get the right information when it was submitted.  This might help reduce
                the amount of difficult parsing that would need to be done. A signature was replaced
                by a checkbox because that is sufficient for most web forms.  
                </p>  
            <p>Testing: Testing was easy because I could click through every link to make sure they all worked.  I had to correct
                several reference issues that I found through this method. </p>
