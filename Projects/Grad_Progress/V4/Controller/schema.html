            <p>Design Decisions: I decided to begin this project with four simple tables.  They can become more complex if I need
                to store more data. <br>
                Users - Contains basic contact information for both students and advisors.  The faculty column is a boolean that will
                distinguish between the two.
                Advisors - This will link every advisor uid to zero or more student uid's. <br>
                Forms - This will link every student to zero or more forms <br>
                Form Data - Each row represents an individual form filled out by a student.
            </p> 
            <p>Collaboration: Chris Weeter and I both have job experience with databases.  We independently  
                created sketches of tables.  Together we added our table designs together to create a better and 
                almost complete version.  I had not thought about a student having multiple forms before talking
                to Chris.  Now I can see we need a form data table as well as a form list that will link students
                to their zero or more forms.   
             </p> 
             <p>
                Schema Modifications Based on Peer Review: We discussed our design with Mitch Penrose and Van Dy, who told us that we needed
                to create a primary key for the table of advisors and students.  We weren't sure if two entries could contain
                both the same student and advisor but different timestamp.  We decided to replace the timestamp if that ever happened. </p>
             <p>Creation: This schema was created using "add table" queries in MYSQL Workbench.  Most of the data types are int (for uID),
                 tinyint(1)(boolean for task completed), varchar(45)(for date and contact information), and timestamp (for distinguishing between
                 forms). </p>
